## FAQ

### Q: Why 100 pages required for recommendations?

A: Building an accurate interest profile requires sufficient data samples. 100 pages is the tested minimum threshold ensuring recommendation quality. You can check current progress in settings.

### Q: How does AI engine assignment affect cost?

A: Different engines have vastly different costs:
- DeepSeek: Cheapest (~$0.001/1K tokens)
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini: Medium (~$0.015/1K tokens)
- Ollama: Free (runs locally)

Using cheap engines for high-frequency tasks (page analysis, feed analysis) significantly reduces costs. Typical user monthly costs:
- Intelligence First: ~$0.15
- Balanced: ~$0.54
- Privacy First: $0

### Q: What's the difference with reasoning mode?

A: Reasoning mode makes AI think deeply:
- Advantages: More accurate results, better logic
- Disadvantages: Slightly slower, higher cost (about 1.5-2x)

Recommendations:
- Page analysis: Disable reasoning (needs speed)
- Feed analysis: Optional (depends on budget)
- Profile generation: Enable reasoning (low frequency and important)

### Q: Is my browsing data secure?

A: Completely secure. All data is stored locally in your browser (IndexedDB) by default, not uploaded to any server. When using AI recommendations, only necessary feature data (keywords, topic scores) is sent, not URLs or sensitive information.

### Q: Can I use free AI?

A: Yes. You can self-deploy local AI service (e.g., Ollama + LLaMA), as long as it's ChatGPT API compatible. This is completely free and more private.

### Q: How much does AI recommendation cost?

A: Using DeepSeek Chat as example, about ¥0.001 per article. Recommending 5 articles daily, monthly cost is about ¥0.15. You can also use local AI service for completely free.

### Q: How to import subscriptions from other RSS readers?

A: Most RSS readers support OPML export. After exporting, import in Silent Feed settings.

### Q: What if recommendations are inaccurate?

A: 1) Ensure sufficient browsing data collected (>100 pages); 2) Click "Not Interested" to help AI learn; 3) Rebuild profile in settings; 4) Try different AI engines.

### Q: How to uninstall extension?

A: Go to `chrome://extensions/`, find Silent Feed, click "Remove". All local data will be deleted.
