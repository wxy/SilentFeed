# Silent Feed — Release Notes (v0.1.0)

## Short description (for store listing)
Silent Feed — privacy-first intelligent feed discovery and reading recommendations powered by local analysis.

## Long description (for Chrome Web Store detailed listing)
Welcome to Silent Feed.

Silent Feed is a browser extension focused on improving personal reading experience. It uses local behavior analysis and lightweight AI adapters to recommend high-quality content matched to your interests while minimizing interruptions.

Key features:
- Smart recommendations: builds a local interest profile and prioritizes recent, high-quality content;
- Privacy-first: sensitive data is stored locally by default; uploads or syncs only occur with explicit user consent;
- RSS support: automatic discovery of RSS/Atom feeds on pages and subscription management;
- Quiet notifications: conservative reminder strategy to avoid notification overload;
- Cold-start optimization: gradually builds user profile during the first ~1000 pages to improve recommendation relevance.

Installation & quick start:
1. Install from Chrome Web Store or load the `.zip`/`.crx` to the Extensions page for manual testing;
2. Open the extension popup and complete the first-run onboarding (choose whether to allow browsing history collection);
3. Visit sites you read often to speed up cold start;
4. Manage subscriptions, privacy preferences, and AI provider settings in Options.

v0.1.0 highlights (initial release):
- Core recommendation engine and local profile storage;
- RSS auto-discovery and basic subscription UI;
- Initial AI Provider test integration (requires user-provided API);
- Reduced-notification strategy and UI improvements (standard and sketchy styles).

Known issues & limitations:
- Third-party AI Providers require user-provided API keys;
- RSS auto-discovery may not detect feeds on some pages;
- Store listing and permissions text may need edits per store review feedback.

Feedback & support:
- Email: support@example.com (replace with real contact);
- GitHub: <repo URL> (replace with actual repository link) — file issues or feature requests there.

## Privacy & legal note (brief)
Silent Feed aims to operate with minimum permissions. By default, browsing history and personal data remain local. Any data sent externally will only occur after explicit user consent. If you need stricter privacy, disable data collection in the Options.
